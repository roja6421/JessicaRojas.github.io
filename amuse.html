    <h1>Funniest Comedian</h1> 
    <h3> By Jessica Rojas</h3>
    <p>I love to laugh and have a good time and I have a few favorite comedians that I love to listen to and just enjoy and relax and have a good laugh. These are some of my best ones that I enjoy watching</p>
    <h2>Hilarious</h2>
    <p>I love this video because it is so relateable of your experiences at the nail salon and this skit is so well done that I find it hilarious and very enjoyable. 
    They way she sounds just like someone doing your nails and how they are constantly trying to upcharge you is hilarious.
    This video is definitely entertaining specially with woman. </P>

    <h2>Kevin Hart</h2>
    <p>I love this skit because it so funny. We are constantly trying to keep up with the Joneses.
     We are constantly trying to flex and try to afford and have the same lifestyle as our friends.
     It is funny on how some people can have more than  us and we have to make sure we realize that 
     we are unable to afford certain things our friends can.

    <h2>Long Beach Comedian</h2>
    <p>Gabriel Iglesias who was raised in Long Beach, California where is a city where I was raised myself.
    He is so relatable as he grew up in the same neighbor and went to the same schools I attended.
    This skit about starting over is funny.
